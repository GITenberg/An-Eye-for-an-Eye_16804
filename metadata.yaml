description: "\"Only one eye for one eye\", also known as \"An eye for an eye\", or\
  \ the law of retaliation, is the principle that a person who has injured another\
  \ person is to be penalized to a similar degree, or in softer interpretations, the\
  \ victim receives the [estimated] value of the injury in compensation. The intent\
  \ behind the principle was to restrict compensation to the value of the loss.\n\
  The principle is sometimes referred using the Latin term lex talionis or the law\
  \ of talion. The English word talion (from the Latin talio) means a retaliation\
  \ authorized by law, in which the punishment corresponds in kind and degree to the\
  \ injury.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
